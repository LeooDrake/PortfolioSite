            After working a few minimum wage jobs, it became clear to me that repetition to me is like a dull knife that slowly chips away at my sanity. Problem solving has always felt like a fascinating puzzle that nudges my curiosity. My obsession to solving such puzzles, will not stop until my solution is concise and satisfies all conditions. I believe this is a remanent from an amazing mathematics teacher I had in senior schooling, I regularly stayed back after class and had a thirst for figuring out the solutions to complex problems.
            <br><br>
            Competing at nationals in 100/200m sprints in 2019 and, learning conversationally fluent Spanish has taught me the discipline needed to succeed. I learned first-hand that the plenty of hours spent alone pays off and that my goals no matter how grand they may seem are achievable. 
            <br><br>
            Growing up around my dad who is an accomplished Computer Scientist, I’ve always had exposure to the technology sector and such opportunities it brought him. Envious in his success, this led me to study Software Engineering at General assembly. Studying at General Assembly gave me the direction I didn’t know that I needed by re-igniting my passion for problem solving. Programming is an emotional roller coaster that challenges me to overcome hurdles and experience a range of emotions. The feeling of finally programming a solution is amazing and keeps me coming back for more. The beauty of what I do is that it constantly tests my knowledge and forces me to adapt, which is why I find it so enjoyable.

                    This Project was created as a challenge to recreate the popular literary game 'Wordle'.<br>
                    Through building this web application I learnt the fundamentals of Front-end web development.<br>
                    the project was created using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
                    </p>
                
                <p>
                    This chatroom was created as an assignment for General Assembl.ly. <br>
                    This project was inspired by early 2000's chatrooms.
                    Hello Kitty Chatroom integrates all Tech-stacks to create a Full-stack web application.<br> 
                    Additionally, I integrated web-sockets to allow for a real-time chat experience.
                    The back-end was created using Flask (a python library) and the PostgreSQL was used for the database. 
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    This game was created collaboratively with 2 other members. <br>
                    This game is about choosing whether you prefer 'This' or 'That'; such being 2 randomly generated items from our database.<br>
                    Items are ranked on our leaderboard with respect to their position in relation to other items.
                    This Full-stack app was created using express app (Node.js) and mongoDB (Non-SQL DB). the Front-end was created using CSS, Javascript and HTML.
                </p>
